President Xi Jinping has launched China’s third stage of political repression(压制)
This Russia scandal(丑闻) is different from the others

Yet of those in China who have called for democracy, resisting the Communist Party’s ruthless(无情的 残酷的) efforts to prevent it from ever taking hold, Mr Liu’s name stands out
His dignified(庄严的 尊贵的), calm and persistent calls for freedom for China’s people have made Mr Liu one of the global giants of moral dissen(不同意，异议)
Mr Liu, an academic and author specialising in literature and philosophy, is eight years into an 11-year sentence for subversion(颠覆 破坏)
His crime was to write a petition(请愿) calling for democracy
Western governments have a long history of timidity(胆小 怯弱) and cynicism(犬儒主义) in their responses to China’s abysmal(糟透的 深不可测的) treatment of dissidents
Western leaders were so eager to win its support in their struggle against the Soviet Union that they made little fuss(焦躁 焦急) about China’s political prisoners.
Suddenly it was fashionable to complain about jailing dissidents (it helped that China seemed less important when the Soviet Union was crumbling(崩溃))
They wanted to show their own people, still outraged by the slaughter(屠杀) in Beijing, that censure(责难 责备) was working
By the mid-1990s China’s economy was booming and commerce consigned(托运 寄存) dissidents to the margins once again
There was not a peep(偷看 窥视) from any of them about Mr Liu, whose terminal illness had just been made known.
China retaliates(报复) against countries that criticise its human-rights record. It restored relations with Norway only last year, having curtailed(缩短 限制) them after  slo had hosted the Nobel ceremony in 2010
Even for little Norway, the economic impact of the spat was limited
And remember that, for those who risk everything in pursuit of democracy, the knowledge that they have Western support is a huge boost even if it will not secure their release or better their lot(命运)
A vital principle is at stake(打赌), too.
China, like Western countries, is a signatory(签约者) to the UN’s Universal Declaration, which says: “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
If the West is too selfish and cynical(愤世嫉俗的) to put any store by universal values when they are flouted(嘲笑) in China, it risks eroding(侵蚀) them across the world and, ultimately, at home too
