Now, can not play LOL, so you can do what you want ?
I fairly dispointed when I still can not control myself.
Finish the database as soon as possible !

These years, for about seven years, we try to do less, try to be jellyfish to
prove that I am samrt, I give to confine and restriction to myself to show that
waht I gain is not by hard-working, instead by cleverness. Let's show some
evidence of it. It's Call of Duty fun, we just keep playing because we think if
we keep studying, and if we loose, we will be laugh by others. This kind of
thing happened over and over again, all just we wanted to show I playing a lot
of games.

We are losing, we are falling down.

We can get nothing if we keep us out of bearing hardship although bearing
hardship is useless and misleading. Now we don't use struggling to achieve, we
do what we think useful with more.

Apply more rules to get more time, apply more restriction on stupid thing to
avoid intelligence damage.

Learn less, do less is a sign of samrt. Doing more quickly more creatively is a
smart.
