Why we should worry so much about others, if you find others are weak, mindless
or lack ambitious, that it's just because you are one of them. Don't talk or
stand with losers. Try to be the sharpest man, that's ok !

Keep delays the homework, the reason is easy, it makes me feels bad !
After comes to the university, we found that we now get used to finished the job
by using more time to finish it instead of by put more minds on it !

Tomorrow, get up at 7 : 30, today sleep before 12, finish the database in 5
hours, we can not afford more time !

Don't try to imagine what you can in do what you are no longer busy, what's
measn of no longer busy, that feelins almost never is rare or never felt. Time
is always precius, the only thing is what is more important !

what's the long-term plans:
    sharp
    explore the meaing of life
    english
    math
    base theory of computer science
    coding

short term plans is always important, but don't addicted to it !

Today, I am twenty two years old, I don't kown how live a way makes me happy, so
I also have nothing to do with how to get it !


# what's happening when browsing zhihu
For three years, we have lost the ability to think a little more when reading,
or watching. Just keep reading without any more thing apart me away from a
thinker far away !
Keep reading, but no difference is made. Ask some question and skeptical. So
next time, reading a article, ask some question. It's fake, it's possible, what
has been hide when author want to persuade us, then we will not read so quickly
!

# What's something more meaningful but can be a substitude for watching vedios
read some news
make some vim
build a project and write some code to it
read some books

# I just could not stop to plays LOL
alhough we delete Windows, time used for LOL is still killing my time. every day
whene sit down, unconsiciouly, we open the browser and begin to watch matches,
it's not fun, just  a habit !

# Every one hates thinking, waht every one wants get a job major in thingking !
we want to get a job just because it pays more instead of it's fun !
