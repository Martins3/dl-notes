# Variational Inference



# Linear Factor Models and Auto-Encoders
We expect unsupervised learning to become far more important in the longer term. Human and animal learning is largely unsupervised: we discover the structure of the world by observing it, not by being told the name of every object."
-- LeCun, Bengio, Hinton, Nature 2015
Besides (kernel density estimation)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation], virtually all unsupervised learning approaches use variables h
- Discrete h (cluster index, hidden state of HMM, map unit of SOM)
- Binary vector h (most Boltzmann machines)
- Continuous vector h (PCA, ICA, NMF, sparse coding, autoencoders, state-space models, . . . )
