# Structured Probabilistic Models for Deep Learning
A graphical model or probabilistic graphical model (PGM) is a probabilistic model for which a graph expresses the conditional dependence structure between random variables. They are commonly used in probability theory, statistics—particularly Bayesian statistics—and machine learning.
1. modeling formalisms is ?

## 1 The Challenge of Unstructured Modeling
many task need to understand the entire structure of the input, with no option to ignore section of it  
1. table-based model ?
2. back-off model ?
3. why smoothed n-gram model face the problem will over fit  the training data badly ?

## 2 Using Graphs to Describe Model Structure

### 2.1 Directed Model
otherwise known as the brief networks or Bayesian networks
1. if m is the maximum number of variables appearing in a single condition probability distribution. so what is m ? parents of node

### 2.2 Undirected Model
1. there is little structure to the definition of the clique,so there is nothing to guarantee that multiplying them together will yield a vaild probability distribution. :question:
2. 经过后面的章节，对于Undirected Graphs 的含义已经不可以理解了！
### 2.3 The Partition Function
[read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_random_field)
1. clique potensial function can determined the probability distribution function is defined or not. not really natural ? thsi amybe result from the fact that  there is little structure to the definition of the clique  
### 2.4 Energy-Based Models
1. unconstrained optimization and constrained optimization ?
There is no accepted guideline for when to call a model an energy-based model and when call it a Boltzmann machine
Boltzmann machine without latent variables are most often called Markov random fields or log-linear models

2. 没有看懂，至少需要补充Boltzmann机的知识才可以，明天上午之前搞定 ！

### 2.5 Separation and D-Separation


### 2.6 Converting between Undirected and Directed Graphs
1. moralize and chordal , reasons !

### 2.7 Factor Graphs


## 7 The Deep Learning Approach to Structured Probabilistic Model
otherwise known as Markov random fields or Markov networks
