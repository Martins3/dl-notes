# Monte Carlo Methods
Random algorithms fall into two rough categories :Las Vegas algorithms and Monte Carlo algorithms

# 1 Sampling and Monte Carlo Methods

## 1.1 Why Sampling?

## 1.2 Basic of Monte Carlo Methods
1. this is just sampling, what is the special place for the Monte Carlo sampling ?

# 2 Importance Sampling
because of the difficulty of  sampling, we introduce the importance sampling
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importance_sampling)
importance sampling want to make a variance smaller
1. distribution of interest

## 3 Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods
use Markov Chain to perform Monte Carlo Methods is called MCMC
1. why Pmodel(x) is represented by undirected model leads to draw exact samples intractable ?
2.
