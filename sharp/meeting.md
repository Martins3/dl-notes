<!-- 2. mnist cifar
3. LFW imageNet -->
4. car detection the article in the AAAI
5. reduce the size of dl  
6. overfitting problem,how can we determine the superparameter automaticly and find the techs for it
7. stoocastic deep network ---> ICCV        dense connected network  two article
8. design the structure of network for example for the pooling !
9. how to generate more data by the precious data we alread have!
10. regularization : how and what
11. how to compare the structure effiently,if the structure of the net is so important
12. arxiv 1311.2901
<!-- 13. 可视化 Jason   -->
14. abstract ideas ,can we learn ! for example, the artist style! *gatys*
15. make the it learn the mathmaticle problem
16. cnn and decnn => colored the map
17. modify the ppicture eg the expression the age the season
18. in the path from the cat_1 to cat_2 ,was that? => we wanted to understand the structure of 激活函数
19. add min noise to the cat to get the dog,but what does it means ?
20. what are determied by the network and what are determined by the data ? :lol:
21. condese the network
22. use the teacher the network to teach the student network which is *hints for thin deep nets*
23. mmd => maximun mean discreping
