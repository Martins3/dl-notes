## notes
1. representaion learning
2. saddle point  the saddle point has only a few downfard curving are present in very large numbers, but
almost all of them have very similar values of the objective function. Hence, it does not much matter
whichof these saddle points the algorithm gets stuck at.
3. cnn
  1. four important aspects: _many layers_ _pooling_ _share weights_ _local connections_
  2. the first layers has the : convolutional layers and the pooling layers
  3. :confused: talk about something easy about the cnn,but too many vocabulary
4. distributed representaion and language processing
  1.
