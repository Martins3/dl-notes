1. The bias is error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm. High bias can cause an algorithm
to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting).
2. The variance is error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. High variance can
cause overfitting: modeling the random noise in the training data, rather than the intended outputs.
