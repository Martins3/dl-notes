# AllWorkStation

This the station where I put all my personal work here,  all the code and documents are under no licence, which means you can use them freely. But to be honest, many project is undergoing and I need much more time to put hands.

There are some highlights here

## [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)
although may trivial trifles hinder me,making it fairly difficult for me have sufficient time for ML,
I declare here this my favorite project.Here are some book notes for the book I read and fight,
for example [机器学习](https://github.com/Martins3/AllWorkStation/tree/master/Atom/sharp/%E6%9C%BA%E5%99%A8%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0) 
or the course I take,[cs229](https://github.com/Martins3/AllWorkStation/tree/master/Atom/sharp/cs229).
I read other books too, but I won't give a detailed list until I have completed them!
